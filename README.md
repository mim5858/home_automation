 In an age where smart technology is transforming traditional home systems, the devel
opment of an intelligent home automation system that optimizes natural lighting offers
 significant benefits.Electric lighting constitutes a substantial portion of energy consump
tion, especially in environments where artificial lighting remains active throughout the
 day. A system that autonomously adjusts blinds and lighting based on outdoor light
 conditions can help maximize natural light usage, reduce energy costs, and improve the
 overall comfort of indoor spaces.This project aims to create a system that automatically
 adjusts window blinds based on real-time outdoor light conditions.The system uses light
 sensor and Pinecone for data processing and by practically analyzing data it will maintain
 optimal indoor lighting while saving energy by adjusting window blinds with motor. By
 responding to changing light levels throughout the day, the system will not only maximize
 the use of natural light but also manage electric lighting when needed. This will allow
 reducing energy consumption, enhance user comfort
